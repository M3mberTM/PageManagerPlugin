# Page Manager plugin

Page manager is a simple Adobe Photoshop plugin made to simplify organization while working in Scanlation. At the same
time, it also comes with the benefit of not filling your scratch disks as fast since you only have one page open at a
time. It aims to simplify and normalize more descriptive naming of files as well as just make the workflow faster.

## Key features
- **Movement between pages:** You can easily move between pages without having to open multiple of them manually
- **Naming based on patterns:** You can name your files based on multitude of patterns such as page numbers.
- **Automatic saving:** Files can autosave on open with the naming pattern picked
- **Shortcuts:** Can use actions shortcuts to easily run the other functionality without having to click even while plugin isn't focused.
- **Preset saving:** Project files configurations and naming patterns can be saved
- **Adjustable settings:** Most of the functionality mentioned above can be changed with settings in the plugin

## Requirements
- Adobe Photoshop CC 2020 or newer (the framework used to build this unfortunately doesn't work in lower versions)

## Known issues

### Files don't load

There are multiple reasons for why this could be happening. If your folder or files
contain any of these characters: `\/:*?"<>|#`, the system won't find it. These are
also characters that Windows doesn't recommend, so please name your files with normal words rather than special characters and the plugin will work.
